# VideoGameIdea
My idea for my final project video game


## Reel Easy
*Reel Easy* is a 2d fishing game where the player casts a line, waits for a fish to bite, and plays a small minigame to reel the fish in. The idea of the game is for it to be a relaxing oldschool vibe fishing experience.

### Mechanics
- **Click to Cast**: The player will cast their line into the water by simply clicking
- **Wait**: Although hard for some, a key aspect of the game will be *patience*
- **Line Tension**: There will be some sort of minigame to keep the fish from breaking off, I have not decided what it should be yet though.

### Dynamics
- Different fish species/rarities/sizes
- The rarer/bigger a fish is, the harder the minigame will be
- A scoring system to tell you how many + which fish you have caught

### Aesthetics
- 2D Cartoony graphics/pixelated
- Calm music and water sound effects
- Simple fishing dock area, pleasing and light on the eyes
